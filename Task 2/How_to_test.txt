HOW TO TEST CircularArray CLASS:
To test the CircularArray class, we'd need to test whether the array values are being stored in the
correct location and whether we can read values from the correct location. We need to test this under
various rotation states of the array, including:
** a non-rotated array,
** an array rotated by 0 (just for good measure),
** an array rotated by a number smaller than the length of the array,
** an array rotated by a number greater than the length of the array, and
** an array rotated by a negative number.

For each of these cases, we'd write some values to the CircularArray and a regular array and compare
each to verify that the values are in the right place. We could then rotate the array, write values,
and compare again, making sure that they're in the right place.
